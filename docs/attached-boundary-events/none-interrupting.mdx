# Non-Interrupting

Letâ€™s add new requirements to our thesis registration and submission process:
* Besides the name of the student and the topic the exam committee defines the deadline for the submission at the start of the process.
The deadline is stored in a variable and is used to define the attached timer boundary event `{#deadline}`
* During the submission phase the students have the possibility to extend the deadline. For doing so they have to send a request with the reason for the extension and the amount of extended days
* In the following step the exam committee proves the reason and the amount of extended days. If the reason is accepted, the committee can set a new deadline for the submission.
* During the submission phase the professor Mary gets every third week a reminder to check in with the students

## Model the process
Add the new requirements to the process model:

## Implement the process
Hint: In order to update the deadline model the request for a deadline extension as an attached interrupting boundary event (We could use a non-interrupting event as well but if we do so we would need to provide some additional code to update the job within the Camunda Engine.)

* Implement a form for the exam committee to check the reason, the amount of extended days and a date field to adjust the deadline
* Define the timer, so the professor mary get's every third week a reminder
* Define the message for the extension request

## Send a message:
Instead of submitting the thesis send a message for an extension request:

```
{
  "messageName" : "yourMessageName",
  "correlationKeys" : {
    "student" : {"value" : "yourStudentInput", "type": "String"}
  },
  "processVariables" : {
    "reason" : {"value" : "Your reason for an extension", "type": "String"},
    "extendedDays" :{"value" : 3, "type": "Integer"}
  }
}
```

Observe the process in Cockpit

## Advanced
Can the same logic be modeled by using an event-based gateway?
